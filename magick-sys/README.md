# magick-sys

this is a sys crate for imagemagick.

it's unstable / wip, so don't use it unless you're working on it.

the main idea of forking and working on this project is:
- the issue is more than a year old on the main repo
- nobody worked at it since then
- in our company, we need to statically compile imagemagick, which isn't working by default on original repo
